Ni Facebook ni Twitter son 'reales reales'
son hipereales

Ethereal entity of a company spreads ahead and above as he moves forward. Legal bubble of bureaucracy wobbling gently, claiming space, reigning over air. Step by step it dissolves and regains consistency.

Zuboff quotes Karl Polanyi's model of three "fictional commodities" on
which industrial capitalism is based: the reinvention of human life as
labor, the reinvention of nature as real estate and the reinvention of
purchasing power as money. For Zuboff, Google adds a "fourth fictional
commodity" that is "emerging as a dominant characteristic of market
dynamics in the 21st century": "'Reality' is about to undergo the same kind
of fictional transformation and be reborn as 'behavior.'  This includes the
behavior of  creatures, their bodies, and their things. It includes actual
behavior and data about behavior."
